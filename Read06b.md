# What is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages.

# What is CSS for? 
CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.

A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language,
but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.

Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience.
Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge , are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.

CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of headings and links.
It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information.
It can even be used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific examples.

# CSS syntax
CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.
For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text."

# How To Add CSS?

There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

* External CSS
* Internal CSS
* Inline CSS
