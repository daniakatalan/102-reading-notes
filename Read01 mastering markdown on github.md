# What is Markdown?
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. 
You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.
Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

You can style Text, have Lists, add Images, Headers & Quotes, Code...

## Examples: 

1. Headers
# heahing1 
## heading2
###### heading6 
  
 2. Emphasis
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

3. Images
